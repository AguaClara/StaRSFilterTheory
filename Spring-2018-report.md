## Abstract
Sand filters have historically been used to lower the turbidity of water and are still used in conventional filtration systems. The research in this report is based on the hypothesis that flocs are captured in rings created by filter grains, which implies there is an active filtration zone where empty pores become clogged by the flocs. This active zone moves throughout the bed until there is no remaining space for particles to clog. This research examines the factors that influence the time it takes for the filter to clog, including size and density of flocs.

## Introduction
Sand filter have been used since ancient times. One of the most common types of sand filtration is the rapid (gravity) sand filtration, used at AguaClara. This filtration method requires the use of flocculant chemicals to aggregate small particles for filtration. The filter has proven to clean the water below 0.3 NTU, meeting the EPA standards. This can be found from experimentation performed on the model sand filter and sand filters in the water treatment plants built in Honduras.

The goal of the Stacked Rapid Sand (StaRS) Filtration Theory sub-team is to develop a mathematical model describing the interaction of flocs and the filter medium. To do so,  relevant filtration parameters must be determined in order to optimize water filtration, and thus filter performance. The ultimate goal of sand filtration is low effluent turbidity and longest filtration duration. Some examples of filter parameters considered were coagulant dosage, influent flow rate, influent turbidity, and backwash duration. The Spring 2018 team incorporated a new factor, floc size, which could potentially affect the effluent turbidity and failure time of the deep sand filter.

</div>

The main goal of the Spring 2018 team was to investigate the idea that the filter has a volume capacity before failure time. The team conducted experiments with a constriction installed; a constriction half the size of the influent tubing was built to reduce the volume of flocs by increasing the shear force felt by the flocs. Further, previous teams have found that experiments at lower PACl dosages saw better filter performance. Thus, the team conducted experiments at lower coagulant dosages, 0.1mg/L, 0.04mg/L and 0.08mg/L, to see confirm this trend. The team sought to determine the effect of flocs volume and low PACl dosage on filter performance after data analysis.

By knowing what parameters affect failure time the effectiveness of the stacked filter could be enhanced. Optimizing the apparatus for longer the failure time and cleaner water will ensure reduced labor work and energy savings since the filter would not need to be backwashed as frequently at the AguaClara plants. Overall, better water filtration achieved via an understanding of filtration physics will lead to more affordable and cleaner water from AguaClara water treatment plants to benefit vulnerable communities worldwide.

The Fall 2016 StaRS filter conducted several experiments to examine the effect of varying coagulant dosage on the filter’s effluent turbidity and failure time. The team used 6 different coagulant dosages (Figure 1), and concluded that there was no visible relationship between effluent turbidity and PACl dosage from these experiments.

The Spring 2017 team’s mathematical and visual model hypothesized that washer-like “dirty” particle built up within the constricted pores of the sand bed in the stacked rapid sand filter(Michael J. Adelman, 2017). It was observed that as the pores were clogged, effluent turbidity increased. In an attempt to confirm the proposed model, the Fall 2017 team conducted experiments to measure the effects of varying coagulant dosages on filter performance.

They also designed experiments to study the effects of shear force between the floc particles and sand medium by changing the flow rate through the filter. From these studies, a pattern was found between dosage and optimizing effluent turbidity over time. Previous AguaClara plants have been built with the assumption that sedimentation processes ought to be designed to achieve the highest particle removal possible, leaving small quantities of floc particles in the effluent water from the sedimentation tanks. However, previous teams hypothesized that leaving some portion of larger flocs in the influent water by controlling the influent flow rate would allow greater aggregation with the smaller flocs. This aggregation of flocs would create larger clumps of particulate matter that would be easier for the filter medium to capture. Further experiments were conducted by previous teams to observe the strength of shear forces on the smaller sized particles, as well as their volume and the overall volume capacity of the sand filter.

The Fall 2017 team systematically varied dosages in subsequent filter runs, to determine the effect of coagulant dose on filter performance and failure time. The team ran the set of experiments twice. The first set was done by gradually increasing PACl dosage, ‘step up’, and the second set gradually decreasing the PACl dosages ‘step down’. They also found out that backwashing the filter for 20 minutes allowed more consistent results. Their findings could better be understood in the following figure (Figure 2). It was concluded from these experiments that at lower coagulant dosages, failure time was longer than that for higher coagulant dosages.

### Experimental Apparatus
The laboratory stacked rapid sand filter was created with a 65cm length of PVC filled with sand with a diameter of 0.5 mm to 0.595 mm to a height of 40cm. There was one influent pipe and two effluent pipes, all with a diameter of 9.4 mm and made from copper. A schematic of full system can be seen below, and was designed to replicate a conventional AguaClara water filtration plant after sedimentation.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">

Refer to all graphs/figures by numbers

Do you have an actual picture of your apparatus?
</div>

Tap water was pumped into the system and combined with clay and humic acid based on the concentrations calculated by MatLAB, with the stream having an average influent turbidity of 5 NTU. The contaminated water stream then entered the influent turbidimeter before going to the contact chamber, where the contaminated water is mixed with Polyaluminium Chloride (PACl), essentially making the clay particles sticky. After leaving the contact chamber, the water entered the flocculator, a helical coil made of flexible tubing with a diameter of 0.625 mm. The flocculator was designed to increase collisions between clay particles to create flocs that could then be more easily removed in the stacked rapid sand filter. The flocculator was designed with a residence time of 2.67 s for a flow rate of 1.98 mL/s. The energy dissipation rate was 0.27 W/kg, which kept flocs small to simulate influent water for filtration after sedimentation.

</div>

Once the water exits the flocculator, it is injected into the stacked filter at an average velocity of 1.8 mm/s. The residence time in the filter was 43.6 seconds on average, after which the water exits the filter through one of the effluent pipes. The two effluent streams mix and then go into the effluent turbidimeter to measure the turbidity of the water. The difference in turbidity between the influent and effluent water can be used to determine filter quality. There is also a 200 kPA pressure sensor immediately before the water enters the filter and immediately after the two effluent pipes combine in order to measure the head loss caused by the rapid filtration.

### Procedure
The goal of the first set of experiments was to observe if density of particles is the defining factor in filter failure because the flocs would occupy more volume.  A constriction was placed in the influent tubing immediately before the filter. The constriction had half the diameter of the apparatus tubing to create a head loss of approximately 8m in the system. The increased pressure breaks the flocs apart, removing the effect of density and particle size on failure time. This experiment was run with PACl concentration of 2mg/L, 1.55mg/L, 1.1mg/L, 0.65mg/L, 0.2mg/L. All experiments were run with a 1.967mL/s influent flow rate, and the influent turbidity was programmed to stay at 5NTU. The concentration of clay and humic acid in the stock tank was determined by the Mathcad file. The pump speed of the PACl pump and concentration of the PACl stock was calculated based on the team’s Mathcad file to achieve the desired concentration of PACl per liter of water. The runtime of each experiment was 12 hours.

The goal of the second set of experiments confirmed the efficacy of the constriction used in the first experiment. Influent clay particles were mixed with red dye and high definition video footage of the flocs before and after the constriction was filmed. A decrease in the average size of flocs would implicate that the constriction was working as hypothesized. The influent flow rate for this experiment was 1.79mL/s. The clay stock concentration was 1.84g/L, and the pump was set to 13.3RPM. The PACl concentration was 0.025mL/s and 0.0125mL/s. Both PACl doses were run with and without the constriction in place.

The purpose of the third set of experiments was to test the hypothesis that there is an optimal PACl dose below 0.2mg/L. At the optimal PACl dose, the filter would have a longer run time than higher doses of PACl without jeopardizing the quality of the effluent water stream. PACl doses of 0.04mg/L and 0.1mg/L were used in two separate experiments.  Both experiments were run with a 1.967mL/s influent flow rate, and the influent turbidity is programmed to stay at 5NTU. The concentration of clay and humic acid in the stock tank was determined by the Mathcad file. The pump speed of the PACl pump and concentration of the PACl stock was calculated based on the team’s Mathcad file to achieve the desired concentration of PACl per liter of water. The runtime of each experiment was 12 hours.

## Results and Analysis
The team wanted to ensure that the filter performed consistent to previous semesters. Thus, an experiment was performed on the filter with 2 mg/L PACl dosage, chosen arbitrarily. A plot of the effluent turbidity vs. time data can be found below (Figure 4). It was found that the filter failure time was around 1.65 hours. Filter failure time was defined as the time at which the effluent turbidity begins to diverge from the constant, low turbidity observed while the filter was operational. This was consistent with data collected from the previous semester. From this result, the team concluded  that the data collected in subsequent tests would be valid.

The following filter tests were performed to test the effects of particle size on filter performance. In these filter tests, a constriction was added before the filter influent line. The purpose of this constriction was to increase the flow velocity, hoping to increase the shear force within the line and break up the flocs created in the flocculator. Thus, the size of the particles entering in filter would be smaller, while the density of the floc was unchanged. The range of PACl dosages experimented with were the same used by previous StaRS Filter Theory teams (0.2-2.0 mg/L of PACl). Error bars for the control experiments were determined using the compiled runs from StaRS Filter Theory Spring 2016 and Fall 2017. A summary of the failure times recorded were plotted against the PACl dosage used for both control and constriction experiments (Figure 5). It seemed that stepping down between 1.55 mg/L and 1.1 mg/L of PACl dosage, there was a sudden change in the way the filter performance was affected by the constriction. The team hypothesized that there may be a balance in the constriction between forces that further flocculation and shear forces that break flocs. For the lower-range PACl dosages, the smaller flocs created are a size such that floc destruction dominates over flocculation at the constriction. Thus, the particles actually became smaller prior to entering the filter, causing the filter to fail later, as the smaller particles can be better entrained in the sand pores. On the other hand, for higher the higher-range PACl dosages, the larger flocs are such a size that flocculation dominates floc destruction at the constriction. Thus, the particles actually became larger prior to entering the filter, causing the filter to fail sooner.

To verify the effectiveness of the created constriction on changing particle size, the Red Dye Experiments were performed. The size of the flocs were visualized with and without the constriction. For the concentration of PACl and red dye used, it was visually determined that the size of the flocs was significantly decreased due to the constriction. Thus, it was determined that the varying filter performance was directly related to the changed particle volume size, as every other parameter was kept constant between experiments with the same PACl dosage. The videos can be found by following the link below:

https://github.com/AguaClara/stars_filter_theory/issues/22

The turbidity difference tests were performed to determine whether or not the size of the particle would have a significant impact on how the turbidimeter read turbidity. It was determined that although there was a consistent different in turbidity between the influent and effluent turbidity, this different was insignificant. The average difference in influent and effluent turbidity was around 4% of the controlled turbidity of the water for the experiments. A graphic with the all the performed experiments compiled can be found below (Figure 6).

Next, the low PACl concentration experiments were performed. The team wanted to explore a lower range of PACl concentrations for filter runs because previous teams have found that while turbidity remained similar throughout all PACl dosages tested, the failure time for lower dosages was much longer. This meant that the filter was operational for a longer period of time when lower PACl dosages were used for same performance levels. The range the team planned to test was 0.02-0.10 mg/L PACL. It was found that the filter did not fail within the 12h time period for the 0.10 mg/L PACl dosage, with effluent turbidity staying between 0.10-0.15 NTU. This was the best performance ever seen for this filter. Next, the 0.04 mg/L PACl dosage was tested. The filter failed around 3.6h, a significant decrease from the 0.10 mg/L PACl dosage. However, it was noted that while effluent turbidity diverged from 3.6h, the divergence was less exaggerated as seen in previous tests for higher PACl dosages. The team believed that there may be an optimal PACl dosage around 0.10 mg/L. The data for each of these tests can be found below (Figures 7 & 8).

## Conclusions
From the constriction runs, along with visual results from the red dye experiments, it was determined that the size of the particles did effect filter performance. It was known that as PACl dosage changed, the size and density of the flocs also changed as a function of PACl added. Thus, the varying performance of the filter, under a controlled PACl dosage, could only be caused by the placement of the constriction and the resulting change to floc size. However, conflicting results on the effect of the constriction on floc size were found. The constriction seemed to have varying effects on filter performance, as controlled by PACl dosage. At larger PACl concentrations, the filter performed worse. While, at lower PACl concentrations, the filter performed better. The team hypothesized a push/pull relationship between how the constriction can both break flocs and act as a site for further flocculation. This relation was hypothesized to be dependent on particle size entering the constriction.

From the effluent turbidity tests, it was concluded that the turbidimeters used largely accounted for differences in turbidity readings due to particle size/particle density in the cuvette.

Maybe say this differently because I thought that the conclusion was that the turbidimeter was not sensitive to particle size and density in the water.

From the low PACl dosage tests, the team concluded that there seemed to be an optimal PACl dosage for filter performance. That dosage was somewhere near 0.10 mg/L PACl, but further testing needed to be performed to confirm this.1

In the following weeks, the team will continue to run the lower PACl dosage experiments: 0.02-0.10 mg/L PACl range. Then, the team will rerun these experiments with the needle valve constriction to replicate the experiments done at higher PACl dosages during the earlier half of the semester.

</div>

In the long term, the team will look to examine the effects of high G flocculation on filter performance. It is hypothesized that the particles that escape the filter are the primary particles that slip past flocculation. This is due to the assumed effect that when particles aggregate into larger flocs, it becomes harder for these larger flocs to continue aggregating with primary particles much smaller than their size (due to shear force and other factors). These primary particles then bypass the filter and exit with the cleaned water. It is believed that high G flocculation will produce a more uniform distribution of smaller flocs, as the high velocity gradient will discourage larger flocs from forming. These smaller flocs will be able to flocculate with isolated primary particles during the flocculation pocess due to the more forgiving size different of the flocs to the primary particles. Further, it has been found that in slow-flocculation, PACl particles tend to stick to flocculator walls, decreasing the expected dosage; in contrast, high G flocculation has been found to fix this problem, resolving the expected PACl dosage (and effectively increasing the PACl dosage from what has been previously observed by the team). This should increase the PACl coverage on the clay particles, making them flocculate and entrain better in the filter.

### Cleaning Procedure
A cleaning protocol was formalized so that each filter run started with a clean filter, flocculator, and system tubing. Cleaning involves steps to help sand in the filter fluidize and clean the filter, clean the walls of the tubing, contact chamber, flocculator, and cuvettes for the next filter run. A successful backwash state is when the filter sand fluidizes completely and the system is in the Backwash state continuously without sand clogging the apparatus and preventing water flow. Vinegar is used in cleaning to reduce the pH of the water and allow the coagulant to dissolve into the water more easily. The state of the system begins in the Off state after a filter run. Only the influent water pump should be on.

* _Backwash Toggle_: Solenoid B is open and closed periodically so that the water pulses through the filter during backwash. Pulsing the water helps the sand fluidize.
  - Open - solenoid valves B, D
  - On - influent pump
* _Backwash and Inflow_: Water flows through the influent and backwash systems
  - Open - solenoid valves A, B, C, D
  - On - influent pump
* _Open Solenoid Valves_: Pre-experimental state opens solenoid valves so that pressure sensor readings between Off and Filter states change minimally
  - Open - solenoid valves A, C, E
* _Calibrate pumps_: Turn a pump on for calibration.
  - On - desired pump for calibration.
* _Toggle_: Tests solenoid valves individually. The setpoint Toggle is used to set a solenoid valve to switch off and on quickly.

### Set Points
* _On_: This setpoint corresponds to Boolean 1 and is used to turn pumps on and open solenoid valves.
* _Off_: This setpoint corresponds to Boolean 0 and is used to turn pumps off and close solenoid valves.
* _Runtime_: This setpoint corresponds to the amount of time a certain state will run until it transitions into the next state (this setpoint is used in automatic mode).

### Variables
* _Influent/Backwash/PACl Pump Speed_: These variables use pump control code. It has inputs of flow rate and mL/revolution. It outputs a pump fraction.
* _Clay Pump Speed_: This variable uses Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control code. It has inputs of P, I, D, a target value, and a current value. It outputs a pump speed. P is the proportional term used to compile present values of error. I is the integral term that integrates the past values of error such that the system can detect how much change in the pump speed is needed to acquire the target value. The P and I values used were 500m and 200m, respectively.
* _PACl Flow Rate_: This variable uses chemical dosing pump speed code. It has inputs of influent flow rate, PACl stock concentration, and PACl dose concentration. It outputs a flow rate, which is used to determine the PACl pump speed.
* _Turbidity_: This variable uses turbidimeter code. It has an input of turbidimeter ID. It outputs the turbidity reading.
