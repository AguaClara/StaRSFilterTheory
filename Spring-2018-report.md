## Abstract
Sand filters have historically been used to lower the turbidity of water and continue to be used in many conventional water filtration systems. Dynamic modeling, as opposed to static modeling, of rapid stand filtration accounts for the buildup of particles over time in the filter, and this understanding is needed for better filter design and operation. Past sub-teams found that head loss increased linearly with time. This research proposed the hypothesis that flocs were captured in rings created by filter grains, which on a larger scale implies an active filtration zone where empty pores become clogged by the flocs. This active zone moved throughout the bed until there was no remaining space for particles to clog. This research examined the factors that influence the failure time of the filter including size and density of flocs.

Is the goal of the current team to test floc size and density on filter failure time?

## Introduction
The goal of the Stacked Rapid Sand (StaRS) Filtration Theory sub-team was to develop a mathematical model describing the interaction of flocs and the filter medium. Thus, the most effective choice of filtration parameters could be determined in order to optimize water filtration. Lowest effluent turbidity and longest filtration duration in stacked rapid sand filtration were the ultimate goals. The parameters included were coagulant dosage, flow rate of pretreated water, influent turbidity, and backwash duration. Currently the team incorporated a new factor, floc size, which could potentially affect the effluent turbidity and time failure of the deep sand filter.

The sub-team’s work-in-progress mathematical and visual model, proposed by the Spring 2017 StaRS Filter Theory sub-team, hypothesize washer-like “dirty” particle build-up within the constricted pores of the sand bed in the stacked rapid sand filter. As the pores were clogged, effluent turbidity increased and failure time occurred. In an attempt to test the proposed model, the fall 2017 sub-team conducted experiments to measure the effects of varying coagulant dosages on filter performance.

By systematically varying dosages in subsequent filter runs, the effect of coagulant dose on filter performance and failure time was determined. Other experiments were designed to study the effects of shear force between the floc particles and sand medium within the filter by changing the flow rate through the filter. From these studies, a pattern was found between dosage and optimizing effluent turbidity over time balanced with minimizing the required volume of the filter based on filter parameters for the given filtration conditions. Previous AguaClara plants have been built with the assumption that sedimentation processes ought to be designed to achieve the highest particle removal possible, leaving small quantities of floc particles in the effluent water from the sedimentation tanks. However, it was hypothesized that leaving some portion of larger flocs in the influent water by controlling the influent flow rate would allow greater aggregation with the smaller flocs. This aggregation of flocs would create larger clumps of particulate matter that would be easier for the filter medium to capture. Following up, this hypothesis experiments were run to measure the effect of changing the flocs’ particles size and the aggregation of these in the sand bed. It was hypothesize that the the volume per particle decreased with size. Thus, flocs could better be captured in the sand grain pores and failure time of the filter could increase. Further experiments were conducted to observe the strength of shear forces on the smaller sized particles, as well as their volume and the overall volume capacity of the sand filter. By Knowing these parameters the quality of the stacked filter could be enhanced, leading to more affordable water treatment plants to benefit more people worldwide.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Consider defining filter performance and failure time as in what do they mean? (the clogging and decreased turbidity removal, time before backwashing?)

Was the pattern between dosing and optimizing effluent turbidity or between dosing and effluent turbidity that could then be used to optimize it?

The sentence "From these studies, a pattern was found between dosage and optimizing..." is too long, it is hard to read and absorb.

The sentence "Following up, this hypothesis experiments were run to measure..." is very confusing and wordy. Consider deleting "hypothesis." Also revise sentence immediately following. I do not know if you mean volume of sand bed per particle or?

Were the further experiments to observe strength of shear forces done by your team or a previous team?

Watch capitalization.

The last sentence alludes to the big picture, but doesn't fully capture the whole idea.

## Literature Review and Previous Work
From previous subteams' work and hypothesis, it was known that changing coagulant dosage changes the performance of the filter. When effluent turbidity increases sharply was when the observed failure time occured. Coagulant dosage changed the size of flocs as well. Therefore, the team hypothesized that smaller flocs could improve the time period the filter operates effectively in particle removal. According to Kuan-mu Yao (1971), "For suspended particles larger than 1 μ, removal efficiency increased rapidly with particle size.” Effectiveness of the filter depends on the size and density of the flocs. From our latest experiment, an orifice half the size of the influent tubing was built and connected to the tube right before entering the filter, such a constriction was purposed break up the flocs, effectively decreasing particle size. It was observed that failure time increased while the effluent turbidity decreased significantly. This was assurance that the constriction successfully achieved its purpose. However, further analysis was needed in order to analyze other factors such as head loss and volume-density-relationship of the flocs. A relation between the size of the flocs and the capacity of the sand grain pores to retain particles led to the second main hypothesize of filter failure mechanisms: porosity. It was hypothesized that the filter fails with a specific reduction in the porosity of the filter bed Przekop & Gradoń (2016). Deeper analysis of this mechanism can be studied by comparing the volume of average flocs with the volume of the pores of the filter medium.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Avoid passive voice

Revise second sentence

The quote from Kuan-mu Yao seems to argue against the previous team's idea that smaller flocs improve the time period to failure. Also very little development of what that means. It just goes into the statement that filter effectiveness depends on size and density of flocs.

Choose either first or third person and stick with it.

At this point, the reader doesn't know anything about your apparatus so the orifice size means very little.

I am confused if this is work that you've done or previous teams have done. Only literature review and previous work should be included here.

To understand how flocs size could be related to porosity, deposition of particles in the medium filter was researched. In their paper, Tien et al. (1979) modeled a sand filter bed using the constricted tube model instead of the classic capillary tube model, in which pores within the filter were similar to long straws with a constant width. It was found that the process of filtration can be split into a two steps. The first part of the model described a clean bed with no particles attached to the grains; as water was run through the bed, particles began to deposit on the sand grains. The second stage of this model sought to account for particle deposition, which changed over time, assuming that the particles coat sand grains uniformly. The model demonstrated that deposited particles increased the volume of solids within the filter. As a result, porosity within the sand bed decreased.

Further, it has been theorized that particles redeposit in other parts of the of the sand bed in a process known as reentrainment. It was proposed that the redeposition of these aggregates was the main reason pores got blocked and the filter clogged or became nonretentive, Tien & Turian (1979).

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Avoid passive voice when possible.

The second sentence can easily be turned into active voice by saying "Tien & Turian (1979) proposed that the redeposition of these..."

Why does the redeposition cause the filter to clog? I think I am missing why it is important (or what exactly that reentrainment is)
</div>

Now the spring 2018 team plans to investigate this hypothesis by analyzing the effect of flocs’ size entering the filter as previously stated. Experiments using a constricted tube to part the flocs at different PACL dosages will be conducted. Head loss and shear forces can be analyzed and potentially considered as parameters that could influence failure time of filtration.

## Methods
The apparatus was set-up in the manner described below. Next, a control experiment was run. For this experiment, the apparatus was not modified, and 2mg/L of PACl was used to dose the clay water. The filter was then run using the instructions found in the Manual section, below. Data was recorded using ProCoDA, including influent turbidity, effluent turbidity and headloss data. From these data, the failure time could be observed from the trends of the effluent turbidity. This is further described in Results and Analysis. After, the apparatus was similarly set up for another experiment. A constriction was fabricated using tubing of the same size as the tubing for the influent line in the future, cement glue and a pipette tip. The pipette tip was cut such that the orifice would be half the diameter of the inner side of the tubing. The tip was then covered in glue, placed into the tubing, and left to dry. The constriction was then attached to the influent line of the sand filter using push-to-connects. Then, the experiment was run using the same parameters as the control experiment.

### Experimental Apparatus
The laboratory stacked rapid sand filter was created with a 65cm length of PVC filled with{sand with a diameter of 0.5 mm to 0.595 mm to a height of 40cm. There is one influent pipe and two effluent pipes, all with a diameter of 9.4 mm and made from copper. A schematic of full system can be seen below.

</div>

Tap water was pumped into the system and combined with clay and humic acid based on the concentrations calculated by the MatLAB file. The contaminated water stream then entered the influent turbidimeter before going to the contact chamber, where the contaminated water is mixed with Polyaluminium Chloride (PACl), essentially making the clay particles sticky. After leaving the contact chamber, the wastewater entered the flocculator, a helical coil made out of flexible tubing with a diameter of 0.625 mm. The flocculator was designed to increase collisions between clay particles to create flocs that could then be more easily removed in the stacked rapid sand filter. The flocculator was designed with a residence time of 2.67 s for a flow rate of 1.98 mL/s. The energy dissipation rate was 0.27 W/kg, which kept flocs small to simulate influent water for filtration.

Why did you pick that residence time and flow rate? Try to justify all values/parameters that you use.

</div>

Once the water exits the flocculator, it is injected into the stacked filter at an average velocity of 1.8 mm/s. The residence time in the filter was 43.6 seconds on average, after which the water exits the filter through one of the effluent pipes. The two effluents mix and then go into the effluent turbidimeter to measure the turbidity of the water. The difference in turbidity between the influent and effluent water can be used to determine the overall effectiveness of the filter. There is also a 200 kPA pressure sensor immediately before the water enters the filter, and immediately after the two effluent pipes combine in order to measure the head loss caused by the rapid filtration.

### Procedure
The goal of the first experiment was to observe if density of particles is the defining factor in filter failure because the flocs would occupy more volume. A constriction was placed in the influent tubing immediately before the filter. The constriction was half the diameter of the influent tubing to create a head loss of approximately 8m in the system. The increased pressure breaks the flocs apart, removing the effect of density and particle size on failure time. The influent turbidity of the system was kept at 5NTU during the course of the experiment using Kaolinite clay and humic acid, and the dose of coagulant was 2mg/L. The experiment ran for 12 hours, and the head-loss through the filter and effluent turbidity were measured for the duration of the experiment.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
This sounds as if you are directly relating size to density because the constriction regulates size not density.

## Results and Analysis
The first filter test was performed to reconfirm the pre-treatment process created in the previous semester to solve inconsistency issues performed between tests. This process can be found below, in the Manual section of this report. Thus, the filter run in which 2mg/L PACl dosage was used. The experiment was performed, and the team observed the effluent turbidity as a function of time. A plot of this data can be found below. The filter failure time was examined in this test. Filter failure time is defined by the team as the time at which the effluent turbidity begins to diverge from the constant, low turbidity observed while the filter is functionally operational. This can be graphically found by observing the time at which there is a sudden upturn in the effluent turbidity data. It was found that the filter failure time was around 1.65 hours. This was consistent with data collected from the previous semester, upon changing the filter pre-treatment process. From this result, the team concluded that the filter pre-treatment process was still viable for the apparatus this semester, and that the team could be assured that data collected in subsequent tests are valid.

Figure 2: Plot showing effluent filter turbidity vs. time for the control test performed to validate filter pre-treatment procedures described in the Manual section of the report. It was observed that the filter failure time occured around 1.65 hours.

The second filter test was performed to test the effects of particle size on filter performance. In this filter test, a constriction was added before the filter influent line. The purpose of this constriction was to increase the flow velocity, hoping to increase the shear force within the line and break up the flocs created in the flocculator. Thus, the size of the particles entering in filter would be smaller, while the density of the floc was unchanged. Again, the effluent turbidity over the duration of the test was collected, along with headloss data. From this data, the filter failure time was determined in the same way as was described above, in the control experiment. It was found that the failure time was around 0.9 hours.

Figure 2: Plot showing effluent filter turbidity vs. time for the 2mg/L PACl dosage with constriction performed to examine the effect of particle size on filter performance. It was observed that the filter failure time in this test was about 0.9 hours.

## Conclusions
From the experiments performed, the team can conclude that the cleaning procedure before performing filter runs is reliable for the apparatus. In combination with the reproduced failure times observed in all filter runs performed from the previous semester, the consistency observed in the 2mg/L PACl dosage control filter run performed this semester with corresponding 2mg/L PACl dosage runs from the past semester added to the assurance of the effectiveness of the pre-treatment procedure.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
I am unsure where the conclusion about cleaning procedure comes from because I don't remember results/analysis about thousandths

Second sentence is a run-on that is unclear. I think the connection between the tests run at 2 mg/l and the implicationns of the pre-treatment procedure are not well established in the report or are spoken about in very different language leading to confusion.
</div>

From the constriction run, it was found that the failure time for the 2mg/L PACl dosage was significantly less than that for the control 2mg/L PACl dosage run. There was a decrease in the failure time from about 1.65 hours to 0.9 hours with the added constriction. This suggests that smaller size flocs lead to worse filter performance. However, nothing can be concluded yet until the results can be reproduced and further testing is performed.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Avoid passive voice
Be careful when using the term "significantly" - It tends to imply statistical significance, which is proven through mathematical evaluation of a value.

Speculate in the results/analysis section why the filter failure time decreases. Are there any additional variables that might be influencing the result? Is this expected?
</div>

## Future Work
In the following weeks, the team will seek to find a trend in the effects of particle size on filter performance. To do so, experiments will be performed involving the 5 different PACl dosages (0.2, 0.65, 1.11, 1.65, and 2mg/L) with the constriction in place. Failure time for each of these tests will be observed and compared with the failure times observed from the last semester. From there a conclusions will be drawn about particle size on filter performance.

In the long term, the team is looking to widen the range of PACl dosages to further delve into the effect of coagulant dosage on filter performance. These experiments will be performed with the intent of future optimization of coagulant dosage to promote the best filter performance. This data can be directly applied to sand filters in Honduras, once scaled appropriately.

### Cleaning Procedure
A cleaning protocol was formalized so that each filter run started with a clean filter, flocculator, and system tubing. Cleaning involves steps to help sand in the filter fluidize and clean the filter, clean the walls of the tubing, contact chamber, flocculator, and cuvettes for the next filter run. A successful backwash state is when the filter sand fluidizes completely and the system is in the Backwash state continuously without sand clogging the apparatus and preventing water flow. Vinegar is used in cleaning to reduce the pH of the water and allow the coagulant to dissolve into the water more easily. The state of the system begins in the Off state after a filter run. Only the influent water pump should be on.
