## Abstract
Briefly summarize your previous work, goals and objectives, what you have accomplished, and future work. (100 words max)

## Introduction
Explain how the completion of your challenge will affect AguaClara and the mission of providing safe drinking water (or sustainable wastewater treatment!). If this is a continuing team, how will your contribution build upon previous research? What needs to be further discovered or defined? If this is a new team, what prompted the inclusion of this team?

The goal of the Stacked Rapid Sand (StaRS) Filtration Theory sub-team is to develop a mathematical model describing the interaction of flocs and the filter medium. Thus, the most effective choice of filtration parameters could be determined in order to optimize water filtration. Lowest effluent turbidity and longest filtration duration in stacked rapid sand filtration are the ultimate goals. The parameters included were coagulant dosage, flow rate of pretreated water, influent turbidity, and backwash duration. Currently the team incorporated a new factor, floc size, which could potentially affect the effluent turbidity and time failure of the deep sand filter.

The sub-team’s work-in-progress mathematical and visual model, proposed by the Spring 2017 StaRS Filter Theory sub-team, hypothesize washer-like “dirty” particle build-up within the constricted pores of the sand bed in the stacked rapid sand filter. As the pores were clogged, effluent turbidity increased and failure time occurred. In an attempt to test the proposed model, the fall 2017 sub-team conducted experiments to measure the effects of varying coagulant dosages on filter performance.

By systematically varying dosages in subsequent filter runs, the effect of coagulant dose on filter performance and failure time was determined. Other experiments were designed to study the effects of shear force between the floc particles and sand medium within the filter by changing the flow rate through the filter. From these studies, a pattern was found between dosage and optimizing effluent turbidity over time balanced with minimizing the required volume of the filter based on filter parameters for the given filtration conditions. Previous AguaClara plants have been built with the assumption that sedimentation processes ought to be designed to achieve the highest particle removal possible, leaving small quantities of floc particles in the effluent water from the sedimentation tanks. However, it was hypothesized that leaving some portion of larger flocs in the influent water by controlling the influent flow rate would allow greater aggregation with the smaller flocs. This aggregation of flocs would create larger clumps of particulate matter that would be easier for the filter medium to capture. Following up, this hypothesis experiments were run to measure the effect of changing the flocs’ particles size and the aggregation of these in the sand bed. It was hypothesize that the the volume per particle decreased with size. Thus, flocs could better be captured in the sand grain pores and failure time of the filter could increase. Further experiments were conducted to observe the strength of shear forces on the smaller sized particles, as well as their volume and the overall volume capacity of the sand filter. By Knowing these parameters the quality of the stacked filter could be enhanced, leading to more affordable water treatment plants to benefit more people worldwide.


## Literature Review and Previous Work
Discuss what is already known about your research area based on both external work and that of past AguaClara Teams. Connect your objectives with what is already known and explain what additional contribution you intend to make. Make sure to add APA formatted in-text citations. If you mention the author(s) in your sentence, you can simply give the year of publication.[(Logan et. al. 1987)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25043431.pdf?acceptTC=true)

From previous subteams work and hypothesis, it is know that changing coagulant dosage changes the performance of the filter. When effluent turbidity increases sharply is when the observed failure time happens. Coagulant dosage changes the size of flocs. Therefore, our team now hypothesizes that smaller flocs could improve the time the filter works for. According to Kuan-mu Yao (1971) “ For suspended particles larger than 1 μ, removal efficiency increases rapidly with particle size.” Effectiveness of the filter depends on the size and density of the flocs. From our latest experiment, an orifice of _____ was build and connected to the tube right before entering the filter, such constriction was meant to break up the flocs. It was observed that failure time increased while the effluent turbidity decreased significantly. Further analysis needs to be made. However, there is a relation between the size of the flocs and the capacity of the sand grain pores to retain particles.  This leads to the second main reason hypothesize to affect filter performance, porosity. Filter fails with a specific reduction in the porosity of the filter bed. For further work this mechanism can be studied by comparing the volume of average flocs with the volume of the pores of the filter medium.

To further understand how flocs size could be related to porosity another terms was taken into account, deposition of particles in the medium filter. In their paper, Tien et al. (1979) modeled a sand filter bed using the constricted tube model instead of the classic spherical model where pores within the filter were similar to long straws with a constant width. It was found that the process of filtration can be split into a two step process to be modeled accurately. The first half of the model is based on a clean bed with no particles attached to the grains. However, as the water was run through the bed, particles began to deposit on the sand grains. Therefore, the second stage of this model sought to account for particle deposition and the deposition changes over time, under the assumption that particles coat sand grains uniformly. The model described how over time, the particulates attaching to the grains increased the volume of solids within the filter. In turn, porosity within the sand bed decreased.



## Methods

Explain the techniques you have used to acquire additional data and insights. Reserve fine detail for the Manual at the end of the report, but use this section to give an overview with enough detail for the reader to understand your Results and Analysis. Describe your apparatus, and have a justification for every decision you made and every parameter you chose in the design of the apparatus. Be especially careful to detail the conditions your experiments were conducted under, as this information is especially important for interpreting your results

Below, some example sections are given. Sectioning the report is meant to keep similar information together.  Continue making sections as necessary, or delete sections if you do not need them. Feel free to add subsubsections to further delineate the information. For example, under the Experimental Apparatus section below, the EStaRS team might consider having sections such as "Filter Design" and "Filter Fabrication".

### Experimental Apparatus
Explain your apparatus setup using enough detail such that future teams can recreate your apparatus. Make sure to explain why you built it this way.
* Design (calculations, constraints)

  $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
* Schematic (label parts)

* Image (from lab; label parts)
* Materials (dimensions, materials)
* Complications in construction
* If already constructed: write a brief summary of important constraints, include any revisions to apparatus, also reference the prior report where construction is described

### Procedure
Discuss your experimental procedure. How did you run your experiment? What were you testing? What were the values of relevant parameters?

## Results and Analysis

Present an observation (results), then explain what happened (analysis).  Each paragraph should focus on one aspect of your results. In that same paragraph, you should interpret that result.
In other words, there should not be two distinct paragraphs, but instead one paragraph containing one result and the interpretation and analysis of this result. Here are some guiding questions for results and analysis:

When describing your results, present your data, using the guidelines below:
* What happened? What did you find?
* Show your experimental data in a professional way.
```python
from aide_design.play import*
x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
y = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
plt.figure('ax',(10,8))
plt.plot(x,y,'*')
plt.savefig('/Users/jillianwhiting/github/Jillian-Whiting/Images/linear')
plt.show()
```
![linear](https://github.com/jillianwhiting/Jillian-Whiting/blob/master/Images/linear.png?raw=true)
Figure 1: Captions are very important for figures. Captions go below figures.

After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?

## Conclusions
Explain what you have learned and how that influences your next steps. Why does what you discovered matter to AguaClara?

Make sure that you defend your conclusions with facts and results.

## Future Work
Describe your plan of action for the next several weeks of research. Detail the next steps for this team. How can AguaClara use what you discovered for future projects? Your suggestions for challenges for future teams are most welcome. Should research in this area continue?
