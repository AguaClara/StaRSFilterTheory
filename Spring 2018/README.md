# StaRSFilterTheory
Repository for Stacked Rapid Sand (StaRS) Filter Theory sub-team.

## Team Members
Barbara Oramah  bio4@cornell.edu  607-882-5795 

Lainey Reed ekr42@cornell.edu   929-453-2518 

Emily Spiek        eas397@cornell.edu   908-723-4492

## Team Goal
Understand the physics of filtration and the failure mechanism in Stacked Rapid Sand Filters in order to model the performance of the filter in existing AguaClara Plants through observing the interactions between influent turbidity, PACl dosage, and floc size.
