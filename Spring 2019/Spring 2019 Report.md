### Abstract

Stacked Rapid Sand Filtration is the last stage in an AguaClara treatment plant. The filters are used to further reduce the turbidity of water to meet EPA standards of 0.3 NTU or less. This semester, the Stacked Rapid Sand (StaRS) Filter Theory team constructed 3 StaRS filters with sand of varying sizes. These filters will be used in future experiments to analyze how specific parameters, including sand grain size and coagulant dosage, affect filter performance. The StaRS Filter Theory team will spend this semester experimenting on the three new stacked rapid sand filters, all of which have sand of different grain size. The team's goal is to understand the impact of sand grain size on filtration.

### Introduction
Sand filtration has been used since ancient times. In AguaClara water treatment plants, a common type of sand filtration is used - rapid (gravity) sand filtration. This filtration method requires the use of a chemical coagulant, polyaluminum chloride (PaCl), to aggregate small particles (flocs) to increase the ease of particle filtration. This filter design has proven to reduce turbidity below 0.3 NTU, which meets the EPA standards. Experimentation performed on the model sand filter in the lab and the sand filters in the water treatment plants built in Honduras have proved the effectiveness of StaRS filters.

The goal of the StaRS Filter Theory sub-team is to develop a mathematical model describing the filter performance. To do so, the relevant filtration parameters must be determined through experimentation. These parameters can then be used to optimize filter performance for minimum effluent turbidity and maximum failure time. The filter parameters that were investigated in previous years include coagulant dosage, influent flow rate, influent turbidity, backwash duration and floc size. The Spring 2019 team will be working on running experiments and analyzing the performance with the 3 new StaRS filters that were built by the previous team. Each of the filters contain 1 layer of sand. The sand grain size within each filter differs.

Last semester, while focusing on fabricating three new filters, the team developed a hypothesis for how sand grain size affects filter performance. The team hypothesized that the filter with the largest sand grains would have the shortest failure time. Failure time corresponds to the time taken for the filter performance efficiency to decrease drastically. The team expects that flocs will be deposited along the sand pores at the same rate in every filter because the rate of the influent stream will be held constant. However, the volume of the filter will be held constant, so when sand grain size increases, the number of sand grain pores in the filter decreases. Ultimately, this means that for a filter filled with larger sand grains, there will be fewer sand pores active at one time. This is demonstrated in Figure 1. This is predicted to cause the active filtration zone to move through the filter faster.

The results of these experiments could hold major significance for filtration methods of AguaClara and other water filtration plants. If it is discovered that sand grain size does impact filter performance, the team will be able to determine the sand grain size that optimizes the desired effluent turbidity and failure time. This parameter could potentially hold major significance when creating a mathematical model that accurately describes StaRS filters. Moreover, using the optimum size of sand in future filters could increase filter duration; filters would need to be backwashed less often, saving the AguaClara plants both time and resources.


### Literature Review

The team conducted a thorough literature review to understand the existing research on sand filtration. The team especially looked into how these other experiments took into account different parameters, including grain size, in their mathematical models.

Many models of filtration include reentrainment, the process by which precipitated aggregate materials get unstuck from pores due to shear force from water and move through the filter, eventually sticking elsewhere ([Przekop & Gradon, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1515/cpe-2016-0033), [Tien et al., 1979](https://doi.org/10.1002/aic.690250302), [Yao et al., 1971](https://doi.org/10.1021/es60058a005)). The team will not be taking into account reentrainment, and instead will be assuming that particles either permanently bind to sand particles or completely pass through the system. Once experimentation begins, the team will be searching to see the impact of neglecting reentrainment in our experiment throughout the semester.

One of the team's goals in varying sand grain size is to understand how the grain size influences ripening time and failure time. Ripening time is the time taken for the filter to reach maximum particle removal efficiency. Failure time is the time it takes for the filter to fail, measured by a dramatic increase in effluent turbidity. Other studies have found that pore size has an effect on ripening time, with smaller pores on a filter leading to longer ripening times ([Przekop & Gradon, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1515/cpe-2016-0033)). This study has shown that physical properties within the filter can affect its efficiency. In future semesters, the property that the team will change is sand grain size.

Investigations into grain sizes of glass beads have found that they have less of an effect compared to changes in coagulant doses ([Chuang & Li, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1383-5866(97)00048-8)). Larger doses of coagulant lead to a shorter ripening time, but also clogged pores at a faster rate and increased the shear force in unclogged pores. However, grain size can have effects based on the coagulant and flocculant dosages. In this study, a flocculant, separate from the coagulant was used to further increase flocculation. The researchers found that larger grains in addition to flocculant and higher coagulant dosages reduced the rate of pore clogging. They hypothesized that it was because larger aggregates were able to pass through the pores between the larger glass beads. In the future, the team will be varying both coagulant dosage and grain size, as in this study. However, sand will be used as a filter material, as is used in AguaClara plants. Furthermore, AguaClara plants only use PaCl, a coagulant, not both a coagulant and a flocculant. The flocculant increased the extent to which the effect was observed within the study. The team would expect to see less of the reduction in clogging that was seen in this study.

As the semester progresses and we run experiments, the team hopes to review more literature to aid with our research.

### Previous Works

The main goal of the Spring 2019 Team was to construct the apparatus for future experimentation. The team focused on building three 1-layered sand filters, each of them connected to a turbidimeter that would measure the NTU units of the filtered water. Prior filters used by different teams differed from the current ones such that they were 2-layer filters.

The 2-layered sand filters were first used by the team from Fall 2013 and they had not been changed until Fall 2018 changed the design. The height of the bed sand was 4 cm, due to the fluidization of the sand bed however, an additional 30% of the height was needed, making the final height of the filter 60 cm. The filter had one inlet stream that infused within the filter through a rectangular orifice and two outlets.

In contrast, the 1-layered filter that Fall 2018 started to build had a sand bed of 20 cm. Calculations showed that a 30 cm total height of the filter would just satisfy the requirements for backwash. In order to be on the safety side, the final height of the filtered decided was 40 cm.
