#### Abstract (100 words max)
Abstracts usually spend
- 25% of their space on the purpose and importance of the research (Introduction) - state what StaRS is, state the independent variables we will be looking at and why we believe it will improve our filter
25% of their space on what you did (Methods) -n/a
35% of their space on what you found (Results) - we don’t have any results obviously but perhaps state our hypothesis  state your expectations for the semester
15% of their space on the implications of the research - basically what our team hopes to achieve

Stacked Rapid Sand Filtration is the last stage in an AguaClara treatment plant. It is used to further reduce the turbidity of water to match EPA standards of 0.3 NTU or less. In this report, we will be researching the effects of different sizes of sand grains as well as ranges of coagulant dosage. By experimenting with the previously stated variables, this will enhance our understanding of the ability of flocs to bind to the surface of the sand grains. Our expectations for this semester is to understand

 By changing these variables, our understanding of the ability of flocs to bind to the surfaces of the sand grains will . Results should show the varying ripening times and the most efficient way to remove flocs.
