#### Abstract (100 words max)

Stacked Rapid Sand Filtration is the last stage in an AguaClara treatment plant. It is used to further reduce the turbidity of water to match EPA standards of 0.3 NTU or less. In this report, we will be researching the effects of different sizes of sand grains as well as ranges of coagulant dosage. By experimenting with the previously stated variables, this will enhance our understanding of the ability of flocs to bind to the surface of the sand grains. Our goals for this semester is to find out the volume of flocs caught within the pores of the sand grains as well as formulating a mathematical model for calculating the depth of the active zone.
