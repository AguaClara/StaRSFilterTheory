        "StaRS (Stacked Rapid Sand) Filtration is crucial to the water treatment process. As one of the last steps in AguaClara’s water treatment, StaRS filters are responsible for removing the last of the unwanted particles. In order to operate effectively under EPA standards, the filters must reduce the turbidity to 0.3 NTU or less. In efforts to better refine the AguaClara filters, variables such as grain size, the height of the active zone, coagulant dosage will be tested in order to increase the failure time. At the beginning of experimentation, the Fall 2019 StaRS sub-team will focus specifically on the grain size. \n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "Sand filtration has been a method of water filtration since ancient times. A common type of sand filtration utilized in AguaClara water treatment plants is rapid (gravity) sand filtration. This method requires the use of polyaluminum (PaCl) as a chemical coagulant to increase the clustering of small particles (flocs) in the water in efforts to increase the ease of particle filtration. This filtration approach has shown to be effective in reducing turbidity below 0.3, which meets EPA standards. Experimentation performed on the model sand filter in the lab and the similar StaRS filters in the water treatment plants in Honduras have also reflected such performance standards. \n",
        "The goal of the StaRS Filter Theory sub-team is to build a mathematical model that describes the performance of the filter. Therefore, the relevant filter parameters must be determined through experiments. These parameters can be used to optimize filter performance to minimize effluent turbidity and maximize failure time. The filter parameters studied in the past include the dosage of coagulant, water inlet flow rate, water inlet turbidity, backwash time and flocculation size. The Fall 2019 team ran experiments that analyzed the performance of the 3 new sand filters. These filters were built based on earlier teams’ research that showed larger sand grains would have shorter failure times. \n",
        "This semester the 2019 StaRS subteam will focus on the effect of sand size on the height of the active zone and create a model to estimate the depth of the active zone of the filters. Given that StaRS filters perform rather well even with only 20 cm of bed depth,our team expects that the active zone height is a tiny fraction of 20 cm. Each of the filters contains a layer of sand, differing in their sand grain size. The StaRS team will use this existing set up to measure performance as a function of time with a constant 5 NTU influent and a range of coagulant dosages. Then, the team will calculate the mass of particles captured by the filters during the ripening period and during the total filter run until failure.\n",

        "## Literature Review \n",
        "The team conducted a literature review to understand existing research on sand filtration. The team especially looked at research done on sand grain size as a factor to effective water filtration.\n",
        " \n",
        "Many research investigations were executed to determine the optimal sand grain size to prolong each run for water filtration. The team understood that the size was a factor but did not have a wide scope of understanding on the extent of this factor or other relative variables. One study <!--which study? please cite at the first point you mention a study--> noted that the larger the grain size, the faster the wastewater flowed through the sand and the greater the amount of wastewater that can be filtered. This was noted with the addition that if the grain size is too large, treatment efficiency would be reduced. This supported the team's intention of seeking the optimal sand grain size for longer failure time purposes. The research found that coarser sand provided less of a concern for clogging (Converse and Tyler, 2000). The ideal sand for intermittent sand filters is coarse sand with an effective size between 0.3mm and 0.5mm (Crites and Tchobanoglous, 1998; Ohio State University, 1999). Such statements provides a helpful starting point for the team to consider what sand grain sizes to run tests for. The published paper also emphasized the significance of the pore space in the sand,\n",
        " as opposed to attention given to the grain particles themselves. While the percentage of void volume generally remains constant as the diameter of spheres changes, the surface area of packed spheres (sand grains, in this case), increases and the size of pores per unit volume area decreases with smaller diameter spheres. An important note was that a granular media filter can improve on filtration efficiency from increases in the surface area per unit of volume, but can suffer in efficiency when the pore size is reduced by too much for sufficient flow during filtration (Ball, 1997). This consideration of the pore size rather than the grain size is an important perspective to take on the team's manipulation of sand grain size. This published paper has provided useful background to help the team proceed with planning test runs. The parameters and explanations of significance have helped the team understand the effect of certain variables on the failure time. In addition, the ranges for sand grain size stated in the literature reviewed has provided a helpful consideration for a starting point for future test runs.\n",

        "\n",
        "The Fall 2018 team focused on the reconstruction of the apparatus. The team developed a hypothesis for how sand grain size affects filter performance. They also constructed three 1-layer sand filters and fabricated brass inlet and outlet pipes, and scaled the values down to be compatible with the new 1-layer filters using calculations from previous teams' reports. But they did not begin the experimentation due to various factors.\n",

The end goal being to develop a mathematical model that best describes the efficiency of a filter and the variables that affect failure time. When experimentation began for this team, the filters showed signs of leaking and the team spent most of the semester fabricating a new filter to replace the leaking one. At this point, the filters should no longer show signs of leakage and progress on differing grain size effects can continue to be made. Additionally, the new filter provides a better understanding of the fabrication of the filters and how leakage can occur and be fixed.\n",

        "##Methods\n",
        "Due to time spent on redesigning and fixing the apparatus, in addition to waiting for new materials, the StaRS team this semester was unable to conduct experiments and collect data. Even so, the team has constructed a new Procoda file to appropriately operate the new apparatus due to changes on the general water flow during forward flow and backwash, as explained in the following section, Experimental Apparatus. The water pump was also changed to accomodate the faster pump rate necessary for backwash. Such adjustments to the team's equipment and technology were necessary to make efficient progress and properly prepare for collection of meaningful data next semester. \n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, as to make progress in understanding the known and potential shortcomings of the experimental apparatus, the team ran backwash on each of the filters for approximately 12 minutes. This was done in effort to watch for leaks and potential mistakes with calling operations with Procoda, as well as, clean out the mold throughout the system."

        "## Experimental Apparatus\n",
        "\n",
        "The Fall 2019 StaRS filter team developed a new apparatus in order to simplify the variables invovled in experimentation. In previous years, all three filters were tested at the same time. This led to inconsistent data as all three filers could not receive the same amount of water flow due to varying pipe lengths and thickness. Additionally, leaks were common and the apparatus was complex and therefore not easily understood by incoming subteam members. \n",
        "\n",
        "The Fall 2019 StaRS new apparatus design tests only one filter at a time. This simplification allows for the use of only two turbidimeters, rather than the four requiered in the past design. One turbidimeter is used for influent flow and the other for effluent flow. Additionally, unlike past designs, the water enters the apparatus and immediately goes through the water pump in both the forward and backwash cycles. This change eliminated the cycling of wastewater that had previously occured during the backwash stage. \n",
        "\n",
        "In the forward cylce, the coagulant and clay are pumped into the mixer and then travel through the modified flocculator. From there the water goes into the influent and through the filter. Once filtered, the clean water goes through the effluent turbidimeter and exits into the wastewater outlet. \n",
        "\n",
        "In the backwash cycle, water flows from the water pump directly to the bottom of the filter where it flows up and out of the top of the filter into the wastewater stream. There is no need for the water to flow through the turbidimenter in the backwash phase because we are already aware of the time it takes for backwash to be complete and are not conducting experimentation on it. \n",
        "\n",
        "While the apparatus can only flow through one filter at a time, all three grain sizes can still be tested. There are three location on each filter column that can manually be adjusted to change which filter and therefore which sand grain size is undergoing experimentation. These location include the top, middle, and bottom inlet/outlets of the filter column. While not in use, these outlets will have plugs in them to ensure water, sand, and other particles are not leaking out of the filter column.\n",
        "\n",
        "An additional adjusment made by the 2019 StaRS filter subteam was the use of consistent pipe sizing. In years prior, the diameter of tubing varied with location within the apparatus. This design leads to inconsisten pressure throughout the apparatus and therefore inconsistent water flow. By creating a design with consistent piping, the variabiliy of water flow is eliminated. In deciding which tubing size to use, it was necessary to measure the amount of kinetic energy throughout the .17in pipes chosen. The calculation showed an acceptable number and so the StaRS team moved forward using only .17in tubing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, the Fall 2019 StaRS subteam replaced the pump previously used in the apparatus. It was discovered that while the old pump could provide enough flow of water to the filters during forward flow, it could not produce a strong enough flow rate for backwash. The backwash flow rate needed is six times the flow rate needed for forward flow. The new pump is able to accomidate for this speed. \n",
        "\n",
        "This new apparatus requires slightly more manual adjustments than previous designs, however, the simplification lends itself to a better understanding of the apparatus as a whole\n",
